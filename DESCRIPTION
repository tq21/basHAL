Description: A scalable implementation of the highly adaptive lasso (HAL) estimator using a basis adaptive sampling (BAS) algorithm.
    BAS samples subsets of HAL basis functions to form candidate basis sets, then iteratively updates the sampling probabilities 
    of the basis functions. BAS avoids the computation and memory bottleneck of evaluating and storing the full HAL design matrix and
    is thus scalable to high-dimensional data.
